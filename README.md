# Mathematics Python Modules

The purpose of these notebooks is to introduce a student to the `python` language and how it can be useful for mathematics, engineering and science students.

The intent is to teach useful skills that allow for:

1. Validation of results.
2. Catalysing the process of complex calculations.
3. Exploration of mathematical concepts.
4. Effective communication and presentation of data.


## Libraries/Modules used

The `python` libraries/modules used are:

* `sympy`
* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
* `math`


## Structure of Notebooks

They have been written so that examples can be followed through the notebook, the student is expected to read the `python` cells (especially the comments) along with the markdown cells. 

At the end of each notebook are questions. There will be cells below the question that the student is expected to modify and run to get the requested output.

The reason for the bundling of questions with examples in the same notebooks is so that functions may be written to aid the students who can then call them to answer questions.
