    "\n",
    "The style of programming that we will be undertaking in this subject is a `notebook` framework. This contrasts with the original style of python, which is more of a `file-based` (or synonymously, `module-based`) framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ways these differ is that the `notebook` style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses cells and evaluates them one at a time.\n",
    "2. Produces output below the cell that called for it.\n",
    "3. Is (arguably) more common in scientific computing and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the `file-based/module-based` style:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Can keep code in multiple files that can then be accessed from one another.\n",
    "2. Produces all outputs to one location.\n",
    "3. Is very common in software engineering environments -- e.g. building apps and running websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intent for teaching you some `python` is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Allow you to validate your calculations, both as a student and practising engineer/scientist.\n",
    "2. Create visualisations to aid exploration, communication and solutions.\n",
    "3. Solve simple problems numerically -- note, numerical methods is a whole (large) field of research.\n",
    "4. Get a taste for a highly useful transferable skill: *programming*."

    "## Nomenclature\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few words that are intended to do more work when mentioned in a programming context than in their conversational meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `syntax`: The structure of valid statements with respect to the `python` programming language.\n",
    "* `keyword`: a word reserved by `python` for use in the language. These words **cannot** be assigned as variable or functions names. It will cause a syntax error.\n",
    "* `sequences`: An ordered set, i.e. a collection of elements that has a logical order to those elements that it contains.\n",
    "* `brackets`: Refer to square brackets `[` and `]`.\n",
    "* `parantheses`: Refer to parantheses `(` and `)`.\n",
    "* `braces`: Refer to braces `{` and `}`.\n",
    "* `variable`: A name that is assigned a value(s)/object(s). **Cannot** be a keyword.\n",
    "* `function`: A repeatable set of instructions that have been formally written so that they are self contained. Can take multiple inputs and (in python, at least) produce multiple outputs. Best thought of as a 'black box' that when provided with the appropriate inputs it causes an action or returns value(s)/object(s).\n",
    "* `object`: A programming abstraction that groups together 'variables' and 'functions', which are then termed 'attributes' and 'methods', respectively.\n",
    "* `class:` Synonymous with object.\n",
    "* `method`: A function that is tied to an object/class. e.g. `my_object.my_method()`. \n",
    "* `attribute`: A variable that is tied to an object/class. e.g. `my_object.my_attribute`\n"

    "The basics types in python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `int`* -- An integer. \n",
    "\n",
    ">    *i.e.* a whole number, a number with no fractional part. \n",
    ">    *e.g.* `1, 8, 99, 1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `float`* -- A floating point number. \n",
    "\n",
    ">    *i.e.* a number with values (even zero values) after the decimal place.\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `2.0, 3.14, 2.71`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `complex`* -- Numbers with an imaginary component, indicated by j.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `2+3j, b+cj, 0.5+0.5j`\n",
    ">   *Note:* The `j` must **follow** the number directly with no other character or operator between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `boolean`* and `None`* -- statements that result from logical comparisons and are termed `boolean` after George Boole, who did work on Mathematical Logic.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `True`, `False` and `None` -- Sometimes `False` just isn't quite right and so a `None` can be used (e.g. in a search, in a matching process or in a set).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `list`* -- A changeable set of values of any type, enclosed within brackets, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`, `[1, 3.14, 'Euler', 9j]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tuple`* --  An immutable (unchangeable) set of values of any type, enclosed within parantheses, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `(4, 5, 6)`, `('d', 'e', 'f')`, `(9, 2.71, 'Gauss', 1j)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `str`* -- A text string of one or more characters.\n",
    "\n",
    ">    *e.g.* `\"Gauss\", \"Euler\", 'Fourier', 'Laplace', \"e\", 'pi'`\n",
    ">    *Note*: That you can use singe-quotes (`'`) or double-quotes (`\"`) to start and end your string.\n",
    ">    *Aside*: You can also make a multi-line string with tripe double-quotes `\"\"\"\"` or triple single-quotes `'''`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `range` -- Used to yield elements of a sequence piecewise. Useful in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `class` -- A way to create and specify the `methods` (class-associated functions) and `attributes` (class-associated variables) of 'objects'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Others:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `instances`\n",

    "\n",
    "Objects are synonymous with classes. They are a programming abstraction that are used to represent real, fictional or new objects. The human mind is very equipped to understand objects and it is quite a comfortable paradigm to write in for most people. Classes and objects are beyond the scope of a rapid introduction to python, but their effects nonetheless trickle down into the things we will do and so they must be examined from a distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of objects/classes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "`list`: Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "`str`: Python strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "`tuple`: Python tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "`symbol`: from `sympy`, used to represent variables, constants, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are synonymous with objects. See objects for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Are standalone procedures that turn instructions into a 'black box'. A function is a set of actions that can be called upon at any time. A set of actions may require you to have some materials and it may produce output -- it also may be beholden to neither of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `function` and a `method` can often be confused, but when `function` is mentioned appropriately, it means a set of procedures **not** tied to an object/class.\n",

    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def my_function(arguments):\n",
    "    # Actions go here\n",
    "    return stuff # If you need to.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See the functions section of this notebook for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a function that **is tied to** an object/class. It is accessed as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_object.my_method()\n",
    "#|------------------|  <-- Can be thought of as a big function call.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will often make use of methods when dealing with libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
