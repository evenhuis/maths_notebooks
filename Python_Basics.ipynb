    "The style of programming that we will be undertaking in this subject is a `notebook` framework. This contrasts with the original style of python, which is more of a `file-based` (or synonymously, `module-based`) framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ways these differ is that the `notebook` style:\n",
    "1. Uses cells and evaluates them one at a time.\n",
    "2. Produces output below the cell that called for it.\n",
    "3. Is (arguably) more common in scientific computing and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the `file-based/module-based` style:\n",
    "1. Can keep code in multiple files that can then be accessed from one another.\n",
    "2. Produces all outputs to one location.\n",
    "3. Is very common in software engineering environments -- e.g. building applications and running websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intent for teaching you some `python` is to:\n",
    "1. Allow you to validate your calculations, both as a student and practising engineer/scientist.\n",
    "2. Create visualisations to aid exploration, communication and solutions.\n",
    "3. Solve simple problems numerically -- note, numerical methods is a whole (large) field of research.\n",
    "4. Get a taste for a highly useful transferable skill: *programming*."
