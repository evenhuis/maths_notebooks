    "The style of programming that we will be undertaking in this subject is a `notebook` framework. This contrasts with the original style of python, which is more of a `file-based` (or synonymously, `module-based`) framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ways these differ is that the `notebook` style:\n",
    "1. Uses cells and evaluates them one at a time.\n",
    "2. Produces output below the cell that called for it.\n",
    "3. Is (arguably) more common in scientific computing and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the `file-based/module-based` style:\n",
    "1. Can keep code in multiple files that can then be accessed from one another.\n",
    "2. Produces all outputs to one location.\n",
    "3. Is very common in software engineering environments -- e.g. building applications and running websites. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intent for teaching you some `python` is to:\n",
    "1. Allow you to validate your calculations, both as a student and practising engineer/scientist.\n",
    "2. Create visualisations to aid exploration, communication and solutions.\n",
    "3. Solve simple problems numerically -- note, numerical methods is a whole (large) field of research.\n",

    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The basics types in python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerics:**\n",
    "* `int`* -- An integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *i.e.* a whole number, a number with no fractional part. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *e.g.* `1, 8, 99, 1000`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `float`* -- A floating point number. \n",
    "\n",
    "    *i.e.* a number with values (even zero values) after the decimal place.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *e.g.* `2.0, 3.14, 2.71`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `complex`* -- Numbers with an imaginary component, indicated by j.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *e.g.* `2+3j, a+jb, 0.5+0.5j`\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note:* The `j` must follow the number directly with no other character or operator between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sequences:**\n",
    "* `list`* -- A changable set of values of any type, enclosed within brackets, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *e.g.* `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`, `[1, 3.14, 'Euler', 9j]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `tuple`* --  An immutable (unchangable) set of values of any type, enclosed within parantheses, separated by commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *e.g.* `(4, 5, 6)`, `('d', 'e', 'f')`, `(9, 2.71, 'Gauss', 1j)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `str`* -- A text string of one or more characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *e.g.* `\"Gauss\", \"Euler\", 'Fourier', 'Laplace', \"e\", 'pi'`\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note*: That you can use singe-quotes (`'`) or double-quotes (`\"`) to start and end your string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Aside*: You can also make a multi-line string with tripe double-quotes `\"\"\"\"` or triple single-quotes `'''`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* `range` -- Used to yield elements of a sequence piecewise. Useful in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes:**\n",
    "* `class` -- A way to create and specify the `methods` (class-associated functions) and `attributes` (class-associated variables) of 'objects'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Others:**\n",
    "* `instances`\n",
    "* `exceptions`\n",
    "\n",
    "Those with a star/asterisk (`*`) next to their name will be explored in this subject, `classes` will be touched upon too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Futher reading on this can be done [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are ever in doubt about what the type of a variable is, you can pass it to the `type()` function that is built-in to python."
